; Fake license screen for FDS
; by TakuikaNinja

; The fake license screen sequence is ubiquitous with unlicensed FDS games, 
; so why can't us homebrew devs also have some fun here?
; Just plop this in as the IRQ vector at $dffe, and overwrite it afterwards if needed.

; Explanation:
; This uses a newly discovered IRQ hijack method which requires a file to be loaded starting from $0200-$07ff,
; and "overflow" into mirrored zeropage at $0800. The FDS BIOS fails to account for this.
; The file load destination pointer at ($0A) is modified to point to the mirrored stack page at $0900, 
; which allows the IRQ flag at $0101 ($0901) to be overwritten with $c0.
; Doing so causes the next IRQ from the disk load process to execute the IRQ vector stored at $dffe, 
; which points to this custom program in system RAM. (I sure hope you're clearing system RAM during reset...)

; The proper license screen bypass is already done by the time the fake one is displayed, 
; so feel free to skip the whole thing with a soft-reset.

; Set the following flag to 0 to skip the message:
.if DEBUG = 1
	SHOW_MESSAGE = 0
.else
	SHOW_MESSAGE = 1
.endif
